## Make a Thing (01.15.26 - 01.22.26)

Once I saw the assignment, I started to think over and over again "Make a Thing...what does it mean and what can I make?"

The first thing that came to mind was a smaller scale and doable game since I only had a week timeframe to complete it.

I decided to use Bitsy for my project since it looked easy to use and simple. Originally I wanted to make a game/experience about making different kind of eggs. It would kind of be a continuation of my [VarJam](https://jbodika.github.io/CART-253/Assignments/VariationJam/) game from CART 253, it was a smoothie making game. Although I realized that would not be feasible with bitsy due to its lack of flexibility and its countless limitations for example with colors. I wanted to add more than one colour to a sprite or an item, but the program wouldn't let me. So I decided to adapt. 

I tried just started playing around with the different features bitsy offers, and i enjoyed how freely I could move the character. the idea of a riddle game came to me since I wanted to play around with free movement and make it gamified. I've made pixel art before but I wanted to keep it simple and short so I made the graphics alphabet letters. I allow the user to read a riddle and move throughout the different spaces to solve the riddles. All of the riddles are about alphabet letters so it makes it easier. 

I believe I could expand on this project by adding more elements to the environment to allow it to be more polished and look better but I am happy of what I produced in such little time. This assignment allowed me to explore different small scale game building tools and I'm eager to try the rest of them in my free time.
